Chess Board Detection Algorithm - Draft 1
---------------------------------------------------------
I will first create up flawless bitmap test image of a chess board without a physical boarder, just the black/white s
quares with a contrasting green background(this is an arbitrary colour).

The first objective will be to scan the image (top left - to bottom right) and detect 
pixel grouping concentration of either 0 or 255, namely black or white.
A simple nested loop will be used for this.

Know parameters - We know the board will be divided into 8 equal blocks in the X and Y coordinate plane, 
so If I know the image to be 600X600 for instance, I can then infer than any one block of colour 
will be no greater than 75 pixels (600/8). A simple test within these parameters will determine the
colour square colour. When we find a 'cell' as it were, we can then use simple maths to find the
centre of the square and also then infer it's neighbour cell. 



When each 'cell' has been accounted for, we have options open to us for manipulation, 
I.e. storing in a 2D array. We can also state that if a given area within that call 
has a deviation from it's black/white state, then that cell must be occupied, or In our case have a piece in it.

Unknowns - For the final detection, we must take into account elevation/angle of the camera to the board. 
We will also have to account for noise infiltration from arm movements etc. etc.
