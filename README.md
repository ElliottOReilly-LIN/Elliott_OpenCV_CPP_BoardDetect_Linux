# OpenCV-CPP-Linux_live-feed-detect
This Repository for Board and Piece Detection contains the code for the iterations of the static image tests, 
as well as the final .cpp file ported to run on Linux.

Note: openCV 3.2 for Linux must be installed, with associative libraries to compile and run the program.

The program will detect and extract any chessboard from it's background, then segment into a 2D-64 square array
ready for implementation within a chess engine game. 

It also has a collection of various function attempts and algorithms, designed specifically for chess board recognition.
